# Magneto-elastic-Tip

## Overview
This dataset contains images of the tip of a magneto-elastic setup, along with corresponding positions of the magnet at the end of the beam. The dataset is intended for use with YOLO versions 8 and 9 for object detection tasks.

## Contents
- **Images**: This dataset comprises 589 images captured from the magneto-elastic setup.
- **labels**: Ground truth annotations for the position of the magnet in each image are provided.
